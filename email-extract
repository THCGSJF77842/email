Email-Subject: internship oppo□tunity & odd-ends
Email-Body:

Natalie, <br>

I just rec□ived word from a colleague th□t the Whitehill Mining Company here in t□wn will be hosting a couple of internships over the coming summer for co□puter science graduate students, but more specifically those students with a concentration or general interest in the development of artificial intelligence. <br>

Considering that you’re a computer science graduate student, and one with a co□centration in neuroscience and technology, I feel that you wo□ld be a shoe-in for this position. <br>

Normally I wou□dn’t consider a student with as focused an area as you to pursue a three-month long unpaid crash course, but given the still relative obscurity and compet□tiveness of the AI field, I feel that the earlier you can get your foot in the door the better. <br>

I know yo□r res□rvations will surround the timely c□mplet□on of your research, and while this internship could be a road-block as far as your dissertation is concerned, it would be incredibly foolish to miss out on this opportunity. <br>

The instruction from Whitehill mining was just to contact human resources, and then follow the steps provided by them. Their number is (□□□) □□□-□□□□. <br>

Also, I have another task for you. Once you finish grading the final lab reports for intro to computer programming, if you could look over the remaining un-graded finals and submit the grades into Caravan I would greatly apprec□ate it. The students seem to have un□erstood requirements analysis from way back at the beginning of the semester, but lost that mom□ntum when tasked with OOAD and ER-Modeling. Finish those up and write out a report of wh□t was most dif□icult for the students, and we can use it to amend the curr□culum for next year. <br>

All my best, <br>
Aaron <br>
